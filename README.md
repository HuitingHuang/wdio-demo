# wdio-demo

This project is created for practicing WDIO E2E testing.

The test scripts are located in <code>test/specs</code>

To run the tests: <br>
<code>npm run test</code>

To run specific tests by tags: <br>
<code>npm run test -- --mochaOpts.grep=@loginOHRM-error</code>

To run specific tests by file path: <br>
<code>npm run test -- --spec ./test/specs/loginTests/test.login.error/test.login.error.js</code>

To run specific test suites: <br>
<code>npm run test -- --suite login</code>

To open report: <br>
<code>npm run report</code>
[@wdio/allure-reporter](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/tree/main/packages/wdio-allure-reporter) is applied to generated reports automatically(see the configuration file)

The report of test results will be shown in <code>allure-report/index.html</code> after running the tests

The report can only be generated after at least one spec file has been executed.

To rerun the failed tests if any: <br>
<code>npm run rerun</code>
This command runs the "rerun.sh" auto-generated by [wdio-rerun-service](https://github.com/webdriverio-community/wdio-rerun-service).<br>
The failed tests will be recorded in the <code>rerun-results</code> folder which is also auto-generated only if there are failed tests<br>
Note: Before running this command, "./wdio.conf.js" should be added after "npx wdio run" in "rerun.sh" file
